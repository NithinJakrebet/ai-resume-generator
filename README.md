Problem Statement:
In today's tech industry, the job application process can be an overwhelming challenge, marked by frustration and anxiety. Candidates often find themselves lost in a sea of applications, where even hundreds of submissions may yield only a single interview opportunity. This issue is compounded by the fact that a resume's impact is heavily dependent on its wording and alignment with the job description, rendering even outstanding work experience and skills insufficient if not presented correctly. This reality is particularly daunting for neurodivergent individuals, who may face additional hurdles in navigating the complexities of job applications.

Our Brainstorming Process:
Driven by a desire to alleviate these challenges, our team set out to create a web application designed to personalize resumes for specific job openings by incorporating crucial keywords and phrases. Our goal was to democratize the job application process, making it more accessible and less daunting for all applicants, especially for those who are neurodivergent. Recognizing the pivotal role that precise language and customization play in the success of a resume, we envisioned a solution that would not only streamline the application process but also enhance the likelihood of securing interviews.

The Solution We Envisioned:
Our project was conceived as a dynamic platform where users could input their professional backgrounds, including work experience, education, skills, and projects. Leveraging the power of AI, specifically an AI named Llama, our application would analyze the provided information alongside specific job descriptions. The outcome would be a highly customized resume, tailored to highlight the user's qualifications in the context of their desired role. We planned to bring this vision to life through a sleek front-end interface built with React.js and TailwindCSS, with MongoDB and Python powering the back-end operations.

What Went Right:
Our journey was marked by notable successes, particularly in the development of the user interface. We successfully utilized Tailwind CSS templates to create a clean and intuitive front-end design. Moreover, we were able to integrate Llama effectively, enabling it to offer users constructive feedback on improving their resumes. This feature not only personalized the experience but also provided actionable insights to enhance the overall quality of their applications.

Challenges Encountered:
Despite our progress, we encountered obstacles, particularly in integrating MongoDB with Django. This challenge hindered our ability to fully realize our vision, as it impacted the seamless operation of the back-end infrastructure. The difficulty in establishing this connection posed a significant setback, illustrating the complexities involved in integrating different technologies to create a cohesive solution.

Conclusion and Moving Forward:
Our project represents a significant step towards making the job application process more accessible and less intimidating, especially for those who may struggle with traditional methods. While we faced challenges, particularly in integrating our chosen technologies, the progress we made in developing a user-friendly interface and integrating AI-driven feedback demonstrates the potential of our concept. As we move forward, we aim to overcome the technical hurdles we encountered, refining our application to fully realize our vision of a streamlined, inclusive, and effective job application tool.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
